Welcome to the 2018 Retro Game Jam. The goal is to create a fun game in a short amount of
time. The funnest game wins!

| \|_| | (/__> 

* The game must be built around the given assets. You don't need to use all of them
  and you may scour the internet for other assets if you want. You must keep the general
  idea of the assets given. (In other words, if the assets are 2D pixel graphics, making
  a 3D FPS is not going to fly).
* The rabbits must be the player character graphics.
* Don't break the law while building your game. Use only royalty free, public domain,
  or custom made assets.
* You may not purchase any software or assets to build your game. You may not use
  any software you own that will give you an unfair advantage over other participants.
* Your game assets and source must be licensed with an open source license.
* The moderators may disqualify your game if they feel that your participation was unfair
  or not in the spirit of the contest.
* We recommend you build your game as a HTML Javascript game based on the example.
  However, your game may be written in any programming language on any platform.
  Note, however, if your platform is not available to voters, they will not be allowed
  to vote for your game.
* Voting will take place after the Game Jam deadline. Once voting starts there may be no
  further development.

Judging will be by vote, most votes win. Voters can be anyone. Competitors may ask
friends and family to participate in the judging.

Voting will take place after the Game Jam deadline. Once voting starts there may be no
further development.

There may be other sub categories at the moderators' discretion, but main judging will
be based on the fun-ness of the game alone.

In this repository you will find the assets you must use in your game. You don't have to
use all of the assets and you can add other assets, but your game must retain the general
idea.

The assets that are a non-negotiable to qualify are the rabbits. The rabbits must be
PCs (player characters).

This repo contains example code for a web-based game using the assets. You may use the
code as a base or start completely from scratch using a different game engine altogether.

To run the example, run:

  yarn install
  yarn start

Your browser will open on port 8080 where the game will be hosted locally in
development mode.

To produce a production build, run:

  yarn build

Files will be put in the dist folder.

You may also containerize the application by running:

  docker build -t game-jam

And run it:

  docker run -P game-jam

Your container is listening on port 3000. Your browser will not open automatically.

Hosting will be made available upon request. Your application will need to be
containerized if you want hosting. Setting up continuous integration is essential.
